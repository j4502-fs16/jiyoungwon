      <h1>Communications and PR specialist</h1>

      <p>When I was only 15, I flew more than 12 hours from Seoul, South Korea, to the United States to start my study abroad journey. During my first year, I lived in Oregon with a wonderful host family, and a year later, I moved to a small town in Minnesota, where I finished the three remaining years of high school.</p>

      <p>In 2008, I moved again. This time, the move was to start my college life at the Missouri School of Journalism. During my study, I experienced hands-on journalism and learned reporting, copy editing and news design by working at the Columbian Missourian, a daily, community news organization directed by professional editors and staffed by the university's journalism students. I became a stronger person by managing to work under deadlines and meeting new people with different stories.</p>

      <p>One of the highlights of my college experience is the eight-month internship at The Associated Press in Seoul. It felt unreal to help AP set up its bureau in Pyongyang, North Korea, which became the first international news organization with a full-time presence in the country. It felt even more unreal when I heard live on the North Korean state channel that Kim Jong Il died. I will never forget that moment when the Seoul news editor dialed the AP headquarters in New York and screamed, "Breaking news, breaking news. File the obit!."</p>

      <p>Close to graduating from the university, I had a lot in my mind about what to do next. I enjoyed news design more than reporting and editing, and a part of me wanted to learn communications and public relations. The idea of being the bridge between organizations and the public was appealing. I also felt confident that with my wide range of journalism experiences and my personality, I was in a great position to pursue this career path.</p>

      <p>Since the first day at ASNE, I've enjoyed every second of what I do as communications coordinator. I've improved my writing, editing and design skills, mastered new skills that come handy in the field of public relations and become a more effective communicator. I can't wait to see myself continue to grow. I look forward to my next journey when the time comes!</p>
